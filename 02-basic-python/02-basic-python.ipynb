    "In interactive mode you write your program interactively, i.e., each new statement is interpreted as you type it. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you just run ```python``` without any other parameter, you enter the **interactive** mode. Let's write our very first program:\n",

    "So, let's briefly take that statement apart: it contains a call to the `print()` function and passes a parameter to that print function, the string `Hello World!`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The string is enclosed in quotation marks `\"`; alternatively you can also use single quotes `'`. Given that information, python knows you want to print the string, and it does exactly that.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the equals sign `=` is NOT a test for equality here, but an ASSIGNMENT. This can be confusing for beginning programmers. \n",

    "\n",
    "The data types of `a` and `b`, however, are subtly different. `a` is an integer and `b` is a float. We can check the data type of any variable using the `type()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = 3\n",
    ">>> type(a)\n",
    "<class 'int'>\n",
